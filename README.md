# FrenchForKidsApp
App for kids to learn French

#Introduction
My idea is to create an app that kids up to 12 years old can use as an indroduction to the French language. The app will be in a cartoon like format and will include games that will teach kids about the French language. I will be using Java to program the app and will be using the processing libraries within eclipse to program the app.

Due to the high level of work that would have to go into a fully functional app of this kind I will be creating an overview of the app for example like a trial version.
